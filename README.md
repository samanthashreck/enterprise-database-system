# enterprise-database-system

The goal of this project is to provide a realistic experience in the conceptual design, logical design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of a relational database and associated applications. 

The enterprise is a retailer, such as a department store, discount store, supermarket, convenience store, etc.; I chose Sephora which sells a large variety of products at multiple stores.

Not all products are at all stores. Pricing may be different at different stores. Each store had its own inventory of products and needs to decide when to reorder and in what quantity. 

Sephora has a Website and allows customers to join frequent-shopper programs. Customers may identify themselves with credits cards or cash or that frequent shopper program.

This database tracks inventory at each store, customers' purchases, sales history by store, etc. It has various user interfaces such as store employees and customers. 

The application allows access to record sales, intiate reorders, process new orders that arrive, etc.



There is another readme, README.txt, that explains what is where. It includes instructions for the interfaces, such as suggestions of good customers to test.
